# Final-Master-Project-GG
## Description
This repository contains the files used and produced for the development of the final project: Association study of Val66Met <i> BDNF </i> polymorphism with eating (EDs) and gambling disorders (GD).
The project aimed to assess the association of the Val66Met polymorphism in <i> BDNF </i> with EDs and GD as a transdiagnostic factor, explore modulating factors for this interaction (e.g., psychopathology, personality and clinical severity), and analyze the association between Val66Met polymorphism in <i> BDNF </i> and treatment outcome in patients diagnosed with EDs and GD.

To explore these associations, the Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was genotyped for patients with anorexia nervosa restrictive-type (AN-R), anorexia nervosa purging-type (AN-P), bulimia nervosa (BN) and gambling disorder (GD).

## Input files
*	`base.xlsx`: dataset containing data from all patients for all diagnoses. <i> Due to data protection reasons, input files cannot be shared.</i>

## Scripts
*	`Analysis.Rmd`: script exploring:
 * * the baseline characteristics of participants according to diagnosis (Table 1).
 * * the baseline sociodemographic, clinical and psychometric variables between carriers and non-carriers of the Met variant within the <i> BDNF </i> gene (Table S1 and Figure 1).
 * * severity scores between carriers and non-carriers of the Met variant within the <i> BDNF </i> gene (Figure 2).
 * * treatment response between carriers and non-carriers of the Met variant within the <i> BDNF </i> gene (Table S2 and Figure 3).

The output file was `Analysis.html`.

## Requirements
* `gtsummary` package
