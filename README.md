# Final-Master-Project-GG
## Description
This repository contains the files used and produced for the development of the final project: Association study of Val66Met <i> BDNF </i> polymorphism with eating (EDs) and gambling disorders (GD).
The project aimed to assess the association of the Val66Met polymorphism in <i> BDNF </i> with EDs and GD as a transdiagnostic factor, explore modulating factors for this interaction (e.g., psychopathology, personality and clinical severity), and analyze the association between Val66Met polymorphism in <i> BDNF </i> and treatment outcome in patients diagnosed with EDs and GD.

To explore these associations, the Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was genotyped for patients with anorexia nervosa restrictive-type (AN-R), anorexia nervosa purging-type (AN-P), bulimia nervosa (BN) and gambling disorder (GD).
